# SLP Course Project Proposal

## 1. Project Title : Voice Transformer

## 2. Motivation

&emsp;&emsp;These days, we are touched to Adobe Audition which can change voice in a piece of speech. But it seems to be not very well. We find that it's meaningful for us to develop a voice transformer since there exists few researches in this field. We can use this voice transformer to change our voice to have fun or protect ourselves.

## 3. Related work and tools

&emsp;&emsp;1. Basic knowledges about sound and speech

&emsp;&emsp;2. Python package tensorflow, librosa

&emsp;&emsp;3. Python GUI develop

## 4. Our proposed solution, plan, milestones, and goal

&emsp;&emsp;We suppose that it's wonderful for us to build a speech processing tool which can change the voice in a piece of speech to another voice which is pretrained. We want to develop a software. It can complete many functions including loading a piece of speech file locally, choosing a pretrained voice. And then it can change the voice in the source file to the choosen voice and save it to a new file. 

&emsp;&emsp;As for our milestone, we plan to find the related works and datasets before October 20th and fulfill our codes before December and then we will focus on how to optimize our model and carry out a graphic interface. Our project will be complete before January 20th.
